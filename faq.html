                <p class="info"><p>What is HackFSU?</br>
    HackFSU is essentially a hackathon - a congregation of people passionate towards technology who come together to create something exciting, something that maybe no one else has thought of all in a span of 24 hours.</br></br>
    When is HackFSU?</br>
    HackFSU is scheduled for April 5th-6th 2014</br></br>
    Who can participate?</br>
    Students from High School, College and Grad School. We give preference to people who are associated with some educational institution.</br></br>
    What can I make?</br>
    This hackathon is targeted towards people who think technology can solve the problems of tomorrow. So, essentially we are encouraging people to use whatever is at our disposal today be it hardware or software to implement any idea they think is innovative/revolutionary/eye-catching/so crazy that no one has thought of it yet!</br></br>
    Are there any rules?</br>
    As with any competition, we must have some rules to keep a level playing field.</br>
    a) NO existing product or source code is allowed. We want to encourage new ideas with this event and not just a re-hash of something already existing.</br>
    b) We do allow usage of open source libraries/engines such as OpenGL, Unity, Google APIs etc</br>
    c) Before using any of the stuff mentioned in point b, you should get it cleared by the mentors assigned to you</br></br>
    I have an idea, but I don’t know where to start...</br>
    If you have an idea, you just need to get off your ass to start. There will be plenty of people who have great ideas but don’t have the technical know-how or people who know how to build stuff but don’t know what ideas click. HackFSU will enable all these people to come together and make something revolutionary!</br></br>
    Do I need to bring anything with me?</br>
    Only thing required of the attendee would be to have a laptop with a working Wifi Adapter. A sleeping bag would help you catch some Zs, if needed, in between.</br></br>
    How many people form a team? What if I don’t know enough people?</br>
    Teams can be of size 4-5. The way we envision the team is to have 1 leader/presenter (He/she leads the team and makes sure his team has access to everything they need, presents the ideas to judges etc), 2 developers and 1-2 User experience analyst(He/She basically makes sure that the idea is user friendly and looks at things without getting tied down to technical details). Of course this configuration is not absolute, but gives you an idea of how work may be divided among people to implement all requirements all the while keeping a view on the bigger picture.</br></br>
    I may not participate, are spectators encouraged?</br>
    We highly encourage everyone to participate however for some reason if you can’t spare the whole 24 hours, we will be having a series of sessions on trending topics of today related to the field of technology at different times. These would be small sessions lasting no more than 30 mins but with high quality content. We also give participants an opportunity to interact with the speaker afterwards. Some of the sessions include - Offensive security and the science behind penetration testing, Drones - are they here to stay? etc.</br></br>
    Can I bring an existing product?</br>
    Any existing product would be disqualified on the spot.</br></br>
    Who is going to be there?</br>
    You would find people from every walk of life all with one common passion - technology.</br></br>
    How do you evaluate my idea? Are sellable ideas preferred?</br>
    Any idea that is implemented and submitted would be evaluated on the following parameters:</br>
    a) Completeness of idea - How far have you thought this through?</br>
    b) Implementation - Can you walk the walk?</br>
    c) Outrageousness - How unique/out-of-the-box is it?</br>
    d) Presentation(How clearly the team can explain their idea to folks without any knowledge in the particular field/niche being targeted)</br>
    e) User-friendliness - Will the user be able to comprehend?</br>
    f) Software stack used vis-a-vis the idea</br>
    With above parameter we are trying to ascertain how the team has performed as a whole on all fronts. We are not looking for business plans/roadmaps, the most outrageous idea may be the one that ends up being the game changer.</br></br>
    I love programming but suck at design, will that make a difference?</br>
    We are not looking for great designs but rather at great user experiences. The focus would be on ideas that work, make sense to the user and have things thought out.</br></br>
    What do the winners get? Any goodies for participants?</br>
    Cash prizes etc. Loads of goodies for all participants!</br></br>
    Can we attend this online?</br>
    We will be streaming content online for people all over the country to benefit from such an event but participation in the hackathon itself would be limited to people who are present physically at the location.</br></br>
    Is there a theme? What kind of ideas are encouraged?</br>
    There is no theme associated with this hackathon. Pretty much anything that catches your fancy will be accepted here.</br></br>
    Can I register at the venue directly?</br>
    We prefer people to register beforehand on our mobile app/website. People can come to the venue directly but we can’t make any guarantees to participation in the hackathon itself. They are however encouraged to stay on attend any of the sessions arranged.</br></br>
    Are only mobile apps encouraged? Any software stack given priority?</br>
    The event is thrown open to all paradigms of technology. There is no preference to any software stack or platform.</br></br>
    I am not sure how these APIs work? Can anyone help me?</br>
    We have small enabling sessions scheduled that will help you get on track immediately with how to use the APIs and what they are capable of.</br></br>
    Do I HAVE to present my idea? Can’t the judges just try it out for themselves? There’s nothing much to say!</br>
    We expect the participants to be able to present their idea to any person inquisitive about it. So there would be a 1-2 hour session post the development phase where the teams would be set up at stalls with their ideas with them. Any and all gimmicks are encouraged to catch the audience’s eye.</br></br>
    Is there just a 1st, 2nd and 3rd in this hackathon?</br>
    Having just a 1st,2nd and 3rd would be plain dull. Some of the prizes we are targeting include:</br>
    a) Funniest hack</br>
    b) Most colorful hack</br>
    c) Best API usage</br>
    d) What did I end up making hack</br>
